Work on two games in Unity, a game based on Vampire Survivors to begin learning Unity since it seemed simple enough, and more recently a card based game.

Most recent code for card game is in the "Card GameAssets/Scripts" folder, most work so far is done in GameManager.cs and Card.cs. Link:

(Never thought that I would have others look at my Unity code, but thought I should include work I've done for github portfolio. Many things should be changed like the amount of public members into serialized private members or the commenting for it to make sense to others, but never thought it would see the light of day).
