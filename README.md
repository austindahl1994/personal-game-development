# personal-game-development
Work on two games in Unity, a game based on Vampire Survivors to begin learning Unity since it seemed simple enough, and more recently a card based game.

Most recent code for card game is in the "Card GameAssets/Scripts" folder, most work so far is done in GameManager.cs and Card.cs. Link:

(Never thought that I would have others look at the work, so I apologize for lack of comments/messy code, but thought I should include work I've done for github portfolio)
