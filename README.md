# personal-game-development
My free time spent learning the Unity engine and C# to bring my ideas to life!

The first game was based off a game called "Vampire Survivors", since it seemed like something simple enough to begin learning game development with Unity. Even though it's simple in many ways, I wasn't really enjoying the gameplay anymore since I had tired myself out of the game, so I put it aside to start learning something else. 

The next project I started on was a card game, with ideas coming from card/Board games I have played previously and from the game "Slay the Spire". The coding for this was fun, figuring out how to utilize OOP in order to save myself time later not having to code the same lines over and over was enjoyable. It's been a great experience putting the tools of what I've been learning in school to use to make something that I enjoy. Currently I've set it off to the side to learn more about web development since I've just graduated from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and want to focus on getting a job, followed by improving myself before coming back to work on this hobby.
