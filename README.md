Work on two games in Unity, a game based off Vampire Survivors to begin learning Unity since it seemed simple enough, and more recently a card based game.

Most recent code for card game is in "Card GameAssets/Scripts" folder, most work so far is done in GameManager.cs and Card.cs. Link below to make it easier.
